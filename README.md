Emotion Prediction Project
This project focuses on developing an advanced NLP model to predict the emotional spectrum of individuals based on textual inputs. By leveraging the libraries of scikit-learn (sklearn), spaCy, pandas, and numpy, we created a robust pipeline capable of analyzing and classifying text data into various emotional categories.

Key Features:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Using pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical operations, we preprocess raw text data. spaCy handles tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

Feature Extraction: We employ CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to extract meaningful features from the text data.

Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms from sklearn are used to train the model. The focus is on predicting emotions such as fear, power, and fame.

Emotion Prediction: The model predicts the emotional state based on the text, providing probabilities for each emotion.

Model Persistence: Using the pickle library, we serialize and save the model and vectorizer for easy reuse and deployment.
